setup-vsdevenv
==============

[GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for setting Visual Studio
build environment variables and paths for subsequent steps in the job.

This can be especially useful for building C++ using the MSVC compiler using
build tools like [CMake](https://cmake.org/) which lack the good sense to find
VS themselves.

See [action.yml](https://github.com/potatoengine/ghactions/blob/master/setup-vsdevenv/action.yml)
for a complete list of inputs and outputs.
